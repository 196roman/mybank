Create an account, log in, view your balance, withdraw, deposit, and view your withdraw/deposit history in your bank file.
just a fun project i did, feel free to use it for whatever. important: passwordch.h was written by geeksforgeeks because i mostly work with cli when theres a log in function
so i don't know how to do it in C++. you can find the whole thing here:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/taking-password-as-input-in-c/
if you'd like to use the test account i made, you can find it in the files. the username is user and the password 1234. i made a few deposits and withdrawls to show how i format
the format the record.
its not secure or anything its mostly a fun project for students learning c++. you can check "outline.txt" for a detailed outline, as i've written this program from scratch twice. lol
