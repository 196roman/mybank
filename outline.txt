1. For the most part, there are two different types of functions you'll need to define:
LOG IN and BANKING functions.
I used seperate header files for these just to make the distinction. You should start writing the LOG IN functions and work on the .cpp file interchangeably.

2. Write out the prompts so you'll know what variables you need to initialize at the start. After you're done, tackle sign up first.

3. Think about the functions you'll need for the sign up portion. Ideally you store the username and password some where indeitfiable. Write the function and test it.
Open the file to see if it's storing the information as intended.

4. Next, log in. You will need a way to verify if a username exists and if a password is correct in terms of the username entered. 

5. Write out the prompts for the banking portion.

6. The computer needs to know if a user already has a balance or if it needs to intiialize the bank account.

7. Preferably, the changes in balance will be documented clearly for the user to read in the file.
